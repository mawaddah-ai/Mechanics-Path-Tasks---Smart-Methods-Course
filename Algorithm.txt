1. Initial Setup:
   - Scan the warehouse layout using LiDAR or vision-based mapping.
   - Define the storage locations and loading/unloading zones.

2. Inventory Management:
   - Fetch inventory data from the warehouse management system (WMS).
   - Schedule tasks: storing, retrieving, and sorting goods.

3. Task Execution Loop:
   For each task in task_queue:
       a. Navigate to the location using path planning (A*, Dijkstra).
       b. Identify target pallet/item using computer vision (QR/Barcode).
       c. Pick up item using robotic arm with suction/gripper.
       d. Navigate to target location (e.g., shelf, truck bay).
       e. Place item securely.
       f. Log task completion and update WMS.

4. Recharging and Maintenance:
   - Monitor battery level.
   - Go to charging dock if <20% battery.
   - Schedule self-diagnostics after N tasks.

5. Emergency Handling:
   - If obstacle or human detected → pause.
   - If malfunction → alert system and move to safe zone.

6. Continuous Learning:
   - Optimize routes over time using reinforcement learning.
